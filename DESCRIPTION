Description: This is the R package for "Statistical inference of dynamical regime changes in stochastic sequences in metric spaces".
We introduce a nonparametric approach that identifies change points of non-Euclidean data in metric spaces. 
Using the metric, we define a metric-based binary partition function that reaches the maximum at a change point. 
We not only show that our approach can estimate the number of change-points and detect their locations consistently 
but also provide that the convergence rate of the estimated change points  is optimal. 
Extensive simulation studies and analysis of a real dataset demonstrate that our method has considerable advantages over state-of-the-art methods, 
especially when data are non-Euclidean or covariance structures change over time.
