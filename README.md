# This is R package for "Statistical inference of dynamical regime changes in stochastic sequences in metric spaces". We introduce a nonparametric approach that identifies change points of non-Euclidean data in metric spaces. Using the metric, we define a metric-based binary partition function that reaches the maximum at a change point. We not only show that our approach can estimate the number of change-points and detect their locations consistently but also provide that the convergence rate of the estimated change points is $O_P(T^{-1})$, which is optimal. Extensive simulation studies and analysis of a real dataset demonstrate that our method has considerable advantages over state-of-the-art methods, especially when data are non-Euclidean or covariance structures change over time.
